I recently earned my PhD in [Societal Computing](https://sc.cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Kathleen M. Carley](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html).  
I study how people encounter and respond to social media misinformation, and how we can design interventions that are not only effective, but also accepted and adopted in real-world settings.

My work bridges disciplines, and I use a variety of computational social science methods including social network analysis, survey analysis, and user studies.

## About Me
My [dissertation](https://kingcatherine.github.io/files//Thesis_Dissertation_March2025.pdf) focused on developing effective and practical countermeasures to misinformation. While there has been substantial work on analyzing the effectiveness of various interventions, little work has been conducted on **user acceptance** — a critical component for implementation.

I studied interventions ranging from individual-level actions (e.g., reporting misinformation on social media) to platform or government-level policies. In the course of my work, I identified understudied strategies, evaluated user behavior and perceptions, and developed evaluation frameworks that consider both effectiveness and user acceptance.

Before CMU, I earned a BS in [Mathematics](https://www.wm.edu/as/mathematics/) and an MS in Computational Operations Research at the College of William and Mary. My undergraduate thesis, ["Nonlinear Models of Zooplankton Communities"](https://scholarworks.wm.edu/honorstheses/71/), was completed with [Prof. Sarah Day](http://www.math.wm.edu/~sday/) and [Prof. Drew LaMar](https://www.wm.edu/as/cams/mathematical-biology/faculty/lamar-md.php).  

For my Master’s capstone, I worked with [Prof. Lawrence M. Leemis](http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/) to develop a [simulation](https://faster-voting.wm.edu) that optimized resource allocation to lower voting times on Election Day.

After graduate school, I worked in industry — including as a Data Scientist at [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) — before pursuing my PhD.
