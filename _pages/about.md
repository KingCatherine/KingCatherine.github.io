I am a 2nd year PhD student in [Societal Computing](https://sc.cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Prof. Kathleen Carly](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html). I am a member of the Center for Informed Democracy and Social Cybersecurity ([IDeaS](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/)) and the Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems ([CASOS](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu)).

Before coming to Carnegie Mellon University, I earned a BS in [Mathematics](https://www.wm.edu/as/mathematics/) at the [College of William and Mary](http://www.wm.edu), where I completed my undergraduate thesis, ["Nonlinear Models of Zooplankton Communities"](https://scholarworks.wm.edu/honorstheses/71/) with [Prof. Sarah Day](http://www.math.wm.edu/~sday/) and [Prof. Drew LaMar](https://www.wm.edu/as/cams/mathematical-biology/faculty/lamar-md.php). I then went on to complete my MS in Computational Operations Research at the College of William and Mary, where I worked on my Master's capstone simulation project with [Prof. Lawrence Leemis](http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/). For my Master's project, I developed a [simulation](https://faster-voting.wm.edu) to lower voting times on Election Day by optimizing the number of resources. I then worked for a few years in industry, including as a Data Scientist at [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org), before deciding to attend CMU to obtain my PhD. 

While my research interests have changed over time, I have always been interested in better understanding technology's impact on society. My current research focuses on the societal challenges associated with social media misinformation and polarization. In particular, I am working on understanding why individuals share misinformation on social media and what effects this misinformation and polarization have on society. It is essential to understand if and how the spread of misinformation is affecting political outcomes, such as election results, the efficacy of public policy, or trust in political institutions and the media.
